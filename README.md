# python-challenge
This is my READMEfile for this week's python challenge. I have setup my folders to reflect the instructions for challenge 3.
I learned how to implement the .f function when printing my numeric reuslts in the text files.
For the PyBank it was .2f and for PyPoll .3f - used for floating numbers/integers instead of the round function - https://thepythonguru.com/python-string-formatting/
